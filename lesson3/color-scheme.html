        <h2>My Color Scheme.</h2>
        <p>
            I was introduced to the Coolors website last semester and I have used it many projects to help choose a pallete. I specifically wanted to incorporate some more green into the new design. My city usually sticks with blue. However, the colors of our local
            high school is green. The main canyon of North Logan is Green Canyon. It seems odd to me that so little green has been incorporated. I didn't want to just duplicate the High School's colors. I think this strikes a healthy balance. I plan on
            using the green or blues for footers and headers. I plan on using the cream color for the main content and the bright blue and yellow for links.
