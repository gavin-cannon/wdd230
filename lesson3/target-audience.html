            Target Audience
        </h1>
        <h2>Audience Description</h2>
        <p>
            As I see it the audience for North Logan's Chamber of Commerce falls into two categories. First, business owners who are in the chamber or want to join the chamber. Second, prospective customers which can be divided into residents and visitors. Of course
            there are exceptions like website managers or city officials. However, those are rare exceptions and their needs will still be met by the website without the site getting distracted.

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            Lets run through a scenario for each of the personas. <br> <br> Ryan Smith comes to the webiste looking for the benefits of becoming a chamber member. He was also curious about the price to join the chamber. Would the cost be worth it? He
            would go to the home page and look for the join page. He would probably look at the other listings to see if joining would be worthwhile. He would try and see if they had an stat about how much joining helps a business grow. He would also
            look at the information about events to see how one creates an event or if an event is something he could do alone or if there was an event he could join.
        </p>
        <p>Maggie Smith would enter on the homepage and look for listings of businesses. She might look for a search function or a way to sort businesses by type. She will be looking for services offered, price, and location.</p>
